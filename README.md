# Flights Scraper

This script serves as my flights scraper for collecting flight information.


# Getting Started
# Installation

You will need to install Selenium and bs4 using pip as shown below:

pip install Selenium
pip install bs4

# How to Use

To get started, you need to input your trip information, including the date, destination, and more. Here's an example:

trip['from'] = "Barcelona"  # Departure city
trip['to'] = 'London'  # Arrival city
trip['depart'] = "20/10/2021"  # Departure date
trip['return'] = "30/10/2021"  # Return date
